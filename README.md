 

  Overview

project is a web application that scans devices on the local network and displays their details in a table. The application uses ASP.NET MVC for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend. It includes features for scanning the network, measuring latency, and displaying information such as IP addresses, host names, latency, and MAC addresses.

  Key Components

 # 1.  ASP.NET MVC Application 

-  Controller: `HomeController` 
  -  `Index` Action : Displays the initial view of the application.
  -  `ScanNetwork` Action : Handles the network scanning logic. It is triggered by a POST request from the form on the `Index` view.
    - Retrieves the router IP and local IP address.
    - Computes the subnet based on the router IP.
    - Scans the network for devices and measures their latency and MAC address.
    - Passes the scanned devices to the view using `ViewBag.Devices`.

 # 2.  Models 

-  `Device` Model : Represents a device on the network with properties such as IP address, host name, latency, and MAC address.

 # 3.  View 

-  `Index.cshtml` View : 
  - Displays the form to initiate the network scan.
  - Uses `ViewBag.Devices` to show a table of scanned devices.
  - Includes a loading overlay that appears while the network scan is in progress.

 # 4.  CSS Styles 

-  Loading Overlay : Provides a visual indicator that the network scan is in progress.
  -  `.loading-overlay` : A fixed position overlay with a spinner to indicate loading.
  -  `.spinner` : A rotating spinner animation created using CSS.

 # 5.  JavaScript 

-  Event Listeners :
  -  Form Submission : Displays the loading overlay when the form is submitted.
  -  Window Load : Hides the loading overlay once the page is fully loaded.

  Detailed Code Explanation

 # HTML & CSS

-  HTML Structure :
  - The `head` section contains meta tags, the page title, and a link to the CSS stylesheet.
  - The `body` section contains the main container, header, form, and device table. It also includes the loading overlay.
-  CSS Styles :
  - The `.loading-overlay` class styles the overlay with a semi-transparent black background and centers the spinner.
  - The `.spinner` class creates a rotating spinner animation.

 # JavaScript

-  Form Submission :
  - Shows the loading overlay when the form is submitted to indicate that a scan is in progress.
-  Window Load :
  - Hides the loading overlay once the page is fully loaded to ensure it is not displayed unnecessarily.

 # C# Code (Backend)

-  `HomeController` Methods :
  -  `Index` : Simply returns the `Index` view.
  -  `ScanNetwork` :
    - Retrieves the default gateway and local IP address.
    - Computes the subnet by splitting the router IP.
    - Scans the network for devices, adding the router and local device first.
    - Launches tasks to check the status and gather information for other devices in the subnet.
    - Measures latency and retrieves the MAC address using `arp` command.
    - Adds the device information to the `ViewBag.Devices` for display in the view.
-  Helper Methods :
  -  `GetDefaultGateway` : Retrieves the default gateway (router IP).
  -  `GetLocalIPAddress` : Retrieves the local IP address.
  -  `GetSubnet` : Computes the subnet based on the router IP.
  -  `ScanNetwork` : Scans the network and collects device information.
  -  `IsDeviceOnline` : Checks if a device is online using ping.
  -  `MeasureLatency` : Measures the latency of a device by sending multiple pings and calculating the average.
  -  `GetHostName` : Retrieves the hostname for a given IP address.
  -  `GetMacAddress` : Retrieves the MAC address for a given IP address, including the local device.
  -  `GetLocalMacAddress` : Retrieves the MAC address of the local device.

  Improvements

1.  Error Handling : You may want to enhance error handling for network-related operations and user feedback.
2.  UI/UX Enhancements : Consider adding more user-friendly features or design improvements.
3.  Performance Optimization : Optimize network scanning tasks and possibly implement asynchronous operations more efficiently.
